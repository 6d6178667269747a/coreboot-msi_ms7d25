	  Driver code to store the top_of_ram (TOM) address into
	  non-volatile space (CMOS) during the first boot and use
	  it across all consecutive boot.

	  Purpose of this driver code is to cache the TOM (with a
	  fixed size) for all consecutive boots even before calling
	  into the FSP. Otherwise, this range remains un-cached until postcar
	  boot stage updates the MTRR programming. FSP-M and late romstage
	  uses this uncached TOM range for various purposes and having the
	  ability to cache this range beforehand would help to optimize the boot
	  time (more than 50ms).
